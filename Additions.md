# Ideas to add to NOSETEST
- Test out the list serialization and deserialization libraries
- Utilize the Serializable linked list and write a parser for it in Python and test it...hint it might be broken
- Refactor the TLV type structs to variable length structs where the variable length data is stored at the end
- Change encryption wrappers to work with this
- Add return codes to the response values pased back 
- Add in error code checking for all the places it's not checked (alot)
- Implement new tasks
- Write a cleaner implementaion of how python correlates the task and the response...maybe task ids to correlate responses with outstanding tasks?
- Rewrite how the keying works
- Create some malformed data on either the python side or the C side find and fix the errors
